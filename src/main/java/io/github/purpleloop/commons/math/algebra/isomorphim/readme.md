This package implements the [J.R. Ullman’s Algorithm for Subgraph Isomorphism](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/321921.321925).
 
It is has been translated and adapted in Java from [S. Diemert JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/sdiemert/subgraph-isomorphism).

This work itself was inspired from [A. Neumann's page](https://adriann.github.io/Ullman%20subgraph%20isomorphism.html).
 
This algorithm is exponential and will be slow for large inputs.

The package and the depending Int2DMatrix class can be used in a standalone way regading the purpleloop-commons library.
They are made available under the EPL 1.0 license.
